# Franky.fast - a responsive splashpage

## Overview

**Live version [here](https://fastfranky.netlify.app/)**

I'm currently refreshing my entire JavaScript knowledge through a course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/allcourses)

This next assignment was another small splash/webpage with mobile support. I extended my knowledge and learnt about the viewport (which I was actually already using), transforming text, ordering flexbox items. Box sizing was also thaught in this module, but I wouldn't have been able to complete many of my previous assignments without this one ðŸ˜‰

So in the end, resulting in quite a simple splashpage, which switches flex-directions based on the screen width. And also a deeper dive in formatting input fields and forms, which is something I desperately needed.
